## Knowledge Gained

### Docker

I learned to containerize applications using the Docker CLI and Visual Studio Code. I also acquired skills to push and pull container images on Docker Hub, a container registry. Furthermore, I discovered how to create multi-container applications using Docker Compose.

### Kubernetes

The course enabled me to comprehend the architecture and workings of Kubernetes. I used it locally and leveraged the Kubernetes CLI and Visual Studio Code to run, debug, and troubleshoot applications and services. I learned about Kubernetes pods, the different workloads available, and how to configure networking, storage, and set liveness and readiness probes.

### Labs

The hands-on labs were conducted using local resources, eliminating the need for a Cloud account.

## Skills Development

The course provided comprehensive coverage of Docker and Kubernetes, allowing me to learn how to build and manage containers locally. Through demos and hands-on exercises, I learned how to build and deploy containers. 

Despite no prior coding experience being required, the course encouraged the use of the terminal, command prompt, and VS Code extensively. 

I learned about the concept of microservices and their applications. Additionally, I discovered how to deploy and manage microservices applications packaged in containers locally, preparing me for the cloud environment.
